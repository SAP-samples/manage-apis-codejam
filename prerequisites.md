# Prerequisites

There are hardware, software and service prerequisites for participating in this CodeJam. The exercises will be developed using the SAP API Management capability of SAP Integration Suite and communicating with remote services that will be made available for the CodeJam. 

Alternatively, the remote services can be run locally and we can use [Cloud Connector](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html?locale=en-US) to enable the communication between SAP BTP and the local service. The prerequisites to run it locally are included in [running-locally-prerequisites.md](running-locally-prerequisites.md) *Note: This is recommended if you are doing this exercise outside of a CodeJam event*. 

## Accessing the supporting material referenced in exercises

In this CodeJam, you will see that across exercises, there are references to files that will help you get started or that are needed to complete the activities. To access these files, you can download the individual files directly from the repository website, or you can make a copy of the repository on your local machine by following one of the options below:
1. **(Recommended)** Clone the git repository in your local machine with the following command:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/manage-apis-codejam.git
   ```
   > If you've set up [SSH to communicate with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) from your local machine, you can clone it using the following command: `git clone git@github.com:SAP-samples/manage-apis-codejam.git`

   Using `git` is recommended as there might be future updates on the CodeJam content; updating your local copy will just be a command away.

   ```bash
   $ git pull origin main
   ```
2. Alternatively, download the [repository as a zip](https://github.com/SAP-samples/manage-apis-codejam/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), and unzip it.

### Assign the SAP API Management Role Collections to your user

Once the capability is active, make sure you assigned the following role collections to your user:
* *APIManagement.**
* *APIPortal.**
* *AuthGroup.**

> For simplicity purposes, assign all the roles that match the patterns provided below

Go to your SAP BTP Cockpit. Navigate to `Security > Users`, select your User and click the `Assign Role Collections` button.

### Register as a developer in the API Business Hub Enterprise

Once you've set up SAP API Management, you can access the API Business Hub Enterprise from the SAP Integration Suite home page. 

Navigate to the API Business Hub Enterprise

<p align = "center">
<img alt="Link to API Business Hub Enterprise" src="assets/link-to-api-business-hub-enterprise.gif" width="75%"/><br/>
<i>Link to API Business Hub Enterprise</i>
</p>

Hover over the `Enterprise Manager` item in the navigation bar and select `Manage - Users`. Go to the `Registered Users` tab and click the `Add User` button. Enter your user details, assign the required roles and click the `Add` button.

<p align = "center">
  <img alt="Add user to Registered Users" src="assets/add-registered-user.png" width="75%"/><br/>
  <i>Add user to Registered Users</i>
</p>

If everything went fine, you've successfully registered your user as a registered user of the API Business Hub Enterprise.

### SAP Business Accelerator Hub API Key

If you are going through the CodeJam content on your own or don't have access to a live system, you can use the sandbox environment available as part of the SAP Business Accelerator Hub. To communicate with the sandbox environment you will need an API key. The gif below shows you how you can get an API key from the SAP Business Accelerator Hub.
