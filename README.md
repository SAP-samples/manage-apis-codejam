Welcome to the Managing APIs in your landscape with SAP API Management CodeJam repository. In this SAP CodeJam, we will look at SAP API Management part of the SAP Integration Suite and how we can use it to manage the different APIs exposed by our systems and services.

## API Management Scenario

    <i>As is - Current data flow without SAP API Management</i>
</p>

We work for a company, ITeLO. ITeLO is a large enterprise with offices in 50 different countries. They currently use SAP S/4HANA Cloud as their main ERP and SAP SuccessFactors to manage their employees. Also, within their organization they have multiple development teams and they want to standarise how developers discover/consume/manage the APIs exposed by the variety of systems that they have in-house and external APIs that are consumed by their internal systems. 

Our task is to make accessible and organise the APIs from/consumed by the different systems/services in our landscape. Also, we want to control/limit the number of paths/operations exposed for certain APIs, e.g. the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Business Partner API.

By the end of the CodeJam, we will achieve an API Management scenario like the one below in the diagram.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites to follow the exercises in this repository, including hardware and software, are detailed in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

### Live system

As part of this CodeJam we will try to provide access to a live SAP S/4HANA Cloud instance. Whenever you see the following emoji - üîê - in the exercises, it means that your instructor will provide details to configure a live system. 

<details>
<summary><i>What if a live system can't be provided as part of the CodeJam or you are going through the CodeJam content on your own?</i></summary>
<br>

There are two options here:
1. Use the sandbox environment available as part of the SAP Business Accelerator Hub. When authenticating against the service you will need to specify your API key as a header parameter in the requests.
1. The participant can configure a live system that they have access to.

</details>

## Material organization

The material consists of a series of exercises. These exercises build on each other and should be completed in the given order. For example, we start by creating a simple integration flow, and we will extend it in the subsequent exercises.

The repository includes some [slides](slides.md), which will be used when running an SAP CodeJam event. The slides were built using [Marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marp/) and an HTML export is included [here](slides.html). You can also [preview the slides here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SAP-samples/manage-apis-codejam/blob/main/slides.html).

## Exercises

During the CodeJam you will complete each exercise one at a time. At the end of each exercise, questions are included to help you think about the content just covered and are to be discussed with the entire CodeJam class, led by the instructor, when everyone has finished that exercise.

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can learn more about the subject covered. That way, we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).
