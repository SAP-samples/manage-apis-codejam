## *SAP CodeJam events scheduled*

- 2023-04-##: üá™üá∏ SAP CodeJam BTP: Managing APIs in your landscape with SAP API Management (Madrid, Spain) - TBA.

---

Welcome to the Managing APIs in your landscape with SAP API Management CodeJam repository. In this SAP CodeJam, we will look at SAP API Management part of the SAP Integration Suite and how we can use it to manage the different APIs exposed by our systems and services. By the end of the CodeJam, we will achieve an API Management scenario like the one below in the diagram.

## API Management Scenario

Let's imagine we work for a company, ITeLO. TBD

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites to follow the exercises in this repository, including hardware and software, are detailed in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

## Material organization

The material consists of a series of exercises. These exercises build on each other and should be completed in the given order. For example, we start by creating a simple integration flow, and we will extend it in the subsequent exercises.

The repository includes some [slides](slides.md), which will be used when running an SAP CodeJam event. The slides were built using [Marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marp/) and an HTML export is included [here](slides.html). You can also [preview the slides here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SAP-samples/manage-apis-codejam/blob/main/slides.html).

## Exercises

During the CodeJam you will complete each exercise one at a time. At the end of each exercise, questions are included to help you think about the content just covered and are to be discussed with the entire CodeJam class, led by the instructor, when everyone has finished that exercise.

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can learn more about the subject covered. That way, we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).

See below for an overview of the exercises part of this CodeJam.
