# Exercise 11 - Consume applications

In the previous exercise, we explored how we can add policies to our APIs but not we face a new issue. We require an API key to call our API. 

At the end of this exercise, you'll have successfully called an API proxy that implements the VerifyAPIKey policy in SAP API Management.

## Test API

Justo donec enim diam vulputate ut pharetra. Pulvinar proin gravida hendrerit lectus a. Leo a diam sollicitudin tempor id eu. Enim eu turpis egestas pretium aenean pharetra magna. Et molestie ac feugiat sed lectus vestibulum mattis. A iaculis at erat pellentesque. 


## Summary

We've learnt more about the functionality that's available in the API Business Hub Enterprise for developers and how applications are needed to consume API proxies that perform key validation by using the VerifyAPIKey policy. Now that we've learnt how we can add this basic security to our APIs, let's dive a bit deeper into policies.
